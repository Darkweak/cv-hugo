I recently wanted to switch my infrastructure to a fully dockerized one. That’s when I discovered Traefik, a reverse-proxy project. After many months of using it, I encountered an issue: there’s no caching system in this reverse proxy. Searching the internet, I couldn’t find any solution. So I decided to write my own Traefik caching system. And so Souin was born. Souin is built on top of Ristretto, which is a caching library that Dgraph wrote. In this talk, I will show how I brought Souin from code to deployment.
