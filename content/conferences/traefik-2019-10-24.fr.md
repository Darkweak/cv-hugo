It's been a few years since Les Tilleuls Coop developed monolithic applications. They, and developers around the world, now prefer to use microservices to reduce the risk involved with new code, so they're able to change as little as possible, and not break the application core. To deploy and iterate as fast as possible, they use many different platforms, but with the power of Docker Swarm orchestration, and Traefik service management, they are able to do this all easily. In this session, Sylvain will share a first single project using Traefik and a few services. Then he'll show multiple projects using a single instance of Traefik, and demo how to scale containers.
